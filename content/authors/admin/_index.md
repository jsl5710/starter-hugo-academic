Unleashing the power of AI and NLP, I am a Ph.D. student at Penn State, pursuing interdisciplinary research in data science and AI for cybersecurity. As part of the [***College of IST***](https://ist.psu.edu/), I conduct research at the PIKE Research Lab under the guidance of Dr.[***Dongwon Lee***](https://pike.psu.edu/dongwon/). I focus on applying NLP and machine learning techniques to combat disinformation across languages, contexts, and distribution gaps. At Penn State, I serve as an [***NSF LinDiv***](https://lindiv.la.psu.edu/) Fellow, conducting transdisciplinary research to advance human-AI interaction globally. My mission is to mitigate evolving security threats and enhance access to human language technology  for all. Beyond research, I stay active through dance, fitness, martial arts, and community service.
