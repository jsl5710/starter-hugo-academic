I am a first-year doctoral student in Informatics at Penn State University's College of Information Science and Technology. I am from Grenada, located on the southernmost belt of the Lesser Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean Sea. Currently, I work at the Information, Knowledge, and wEb (PIKE) Research Lab at Penn State as an AI for Cyber Security researcher. I am researching how to combat misinformation in a long tail. I am primarily interested in developing robust, generalizable prose models and AI-powered tools for multilingual false claims detection in low-resource languages utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. My research focuses on bridging the gaps between linguistics, artificial intelligence, cyber security, public health, and informatics. I have a strong academic interest in interdisciplinary research that combines cutting-edge NPL and AI to enhance the language robustness of AI-powered tools, including misinformation detection systems, intelligent voice assistants, and computer-based intelligent tutoring systems. My hobbies include dance, fitness, martial arts, and community outreach.
