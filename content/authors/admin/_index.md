I am a second-year doctoral student in Informatics at Penn State University's College of Information Science and Technology. Currently, I work at the Penn State Information, Knowledge, and wEb ([PIKE](https://pike.psu.edu/)) Research Lab at Penn State University as a Data Science & AI researcher under the guidance of Dr. [Dongwon Lee](https://pike.psu.edu/dongwon/). I am researching how to combat misinformation in a long tail with low-resource, imbalance, multidomain and multilingual data distribution. I am primarily interested in developing robust and generalizable prose models for multilingual false claims detection in low-resource languages. This leverages lingistics, natural language processing and AI techniques. My research focuses on bridging the gaps between linguistics, AI, cyber security, public health, and informatics. My hobbies include dance, fitness, martial arts, and community outreach.
